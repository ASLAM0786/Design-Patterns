/**
**Intent:
1-The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
2-Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
**Problem:

**Solution:

**Applicability:
1- Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
2-Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.
**Pros:
1-You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
2-Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree
 **Cons:
1- It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.
